Configs are symlinked from `~/.config/` except GRUB which deploys to `/boot/` via script.

## Symlink Setup

```sh
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/hypr       ~/.config/hypr
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/quickshell ~/.config/quickshell
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/matugen    ~/.config/matugen
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/nvim       ~/.config/nvim
sudo ln -sf ~/dotfiles/grub/grub /etc/default/grub
```

## Hypr

Hyprland compositor config split into modular files:

- `hyprland.conf` — monitors, programs, visuals, layout
- `components/autostart.conf` — startup services
- `components/binds.conf` — keybindings
- `components/input.conf` — keyboard/mouse/gesture settings
- `touchpad.conf` — touchpad device settings

**Monitors:** eDP-1 (1920x1080@144) + HDMI-A-1 (2560x1440@144)
**Layout:** Dwindle
**Borders:** Animated cyan/green gradient (active), grey (inactive)

**Key bindings (Super = mainMod):**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Super + Return | Terminal (kitty) |
| Super + E | File manager (dolphin) |
| Super + Space | Launcher |
| Super + Q | Close window |
| Super + 1-0 | Switch workspace |
| Super + Shift + 1-0 | Move window to workspace |
| Super + Arrow keys | Move focus |
| Super + C | Toggle float & center |
| Super + / | Keybinding cheatsheet |
| Super + N | Notification center |
| Super + Backspace | Settings panel |
| Super + Escape | Lock screen (Quickshell) |
| Super + Shift + Escape | Lock screen (hyprlock fallback) |

## Quickshell

Qt6 QML-based UI shell. Entry point: `shell.qml`.

**Components:**
- **Bar** — A fully configurable panel. Dock it to any **screen edge**
  (left / right / top / bottom); every widget is orientation-aware. A Settings →
  **Bar** drag-drop board places widgets across three zones (start / center / end,
  plus a **Hidden** pool) and reorders within a zone — and the center zone stays
  locked to the bar's true center so it never drifts. Appearance sliders set
  thickness, background opacity, corner radius, and end padding, with **Reset to
  defaults**. Widgets: Workspaces, Clock, Battery, **System Tray**, **Volume**
  (scroll / click → mixer), **Network** (Wi-Fi + Bluetooth → hub), **Resources**
  (CPU / RAM), **Media** (MPRIS transport with a scrolling title), and **App
  Name** (focused window). Persists to `~/.config/quickshell/bar-config.json`.
- **Launcher** — Search panel (`Super + Space`) with **fuzzy** app search ranked
  by **frecency** (your most-used float up). Empty query shows a **Recent**
  section/strip then all apps. Modes: `/` commands, `!` shell, `=` calculator
  (Enter copies the result), and a **web-search** fallback when nothing matches.
  Configurable from **Settings → Launcher**: position (bottom or centered),
  recents layout (list rows or chip strip), and web-search engine (Google /
  DuckDuckGo / Bing / Brave). Persists to `~/.config/quickshell/launcher-*.json`.
- **HUD** — Right-edge panel, volume and brightness sliders (auto-hide)
- **Connection Hub** — Top-right drawer with Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / Audio / VPN
  tabs. The **Audio tab** is a full mixer: a master slider, output-device
  switching, and a **per-app volume mixer** — each playing app gets a live
  slider, mute, and an inline picker to route it to a different output. Volume
  and mute bind directly to the native PipeWire service (`Quickshell.Services.
  Pipewire`); routing uses `pactl move-sink-input`. Which tabs appear and their
  order are configurable in the Settings panel (drag to reorder, toggle to
  show/hide); persisted to `~/.config/quickshell/hub-config.json`.
- **Notifications** — Popup toasts plus a right-side center drawer (`Super + N`)
  with an MPRIS media player. Notifications are **grouped by app** (collapsible,
  with a count badge), show a relative **timestamp**, and can be **swiped away**
  (drag in either direction; the slot collapses as the card leaves). A header
  **Do Not Disturb** toggle silences popups while still collecting history
  (critical notifications still pop through).
- **Cheatsheet** — Full-screen keybinding overlay (`Super + /`). Per-app tabs
  (Hyprland, nvim, tmux, ghostty, yazi) highlight each app's bound keys on a
  CSS-drawn keyboard; hover a key to see its binding in the detail bar.
  Keymaps are JSON files under `cheatsheet/keymaps/` (one per app); the
  Hyprland map is generated from `binds.conf` by `hypr/scripts/gen-keymap.sh`.
- **Lock Screen** — A dedicated, secure lock instance (`lock-screen.qml` →
  `qs -p … lock-screen.qml`) implementing the `ext-session-lock-v1` protocol
  (`WlSessionLock`) with real PAM authentication (`/etc/pam.d/login`). Themed
  via Matugen, with a large clock, MPRIS media controls, battery, and user
  identity. Every value (components shown, wallpaper/blur/dim, clock & date
  format, password-input position — center or bottom — and hidden input) is
  read from `~/.config/quickshell/lock-config.json`.
  hyprlock is kept installed as a `Super + Shift + Escape` fallback.
- **Settings panel** (`Super + Backspace`) — An extensible settings app with a
  category sidebar. **Appearance** lets you switch the active style variant for
  shared UI components (toggle: Capsule / Square / Notch; slider: Thin / Thick)
  with live previews — the choice is global and re-skins every component across
  the shell instantly. It also sets the **theme color** — keep Matugen's
  wallpaper-derived palette, or pick a fixed seed color (swatch or hex) that
  retints the whole shell plus tmux/yazi/hyprlock. **Bar** configures the status
  bar — screen edge, appearance (thickness / opacity / radius / padding), and a
  drag-drop widget layout, with reset-to-defaults. **Lock Screen** is a
  live-preview editor that tunes the
  lockscreen config and persists it (lazy-loaded wallpaper grid). **Connection
  Hub** lets you drag to reorder the hub tabs and toggle each on/off, with a live
  glyph preview. **Launcher** sets the launcher position, recents layout, and
  web-search engine. **About** (pinned to the bottom of the sidebar) shows a
  read-only system/hardware snapshot — OS, kernel, host, compositor, uptime,
  CPU, GPU(s), memory, disk — gathered live each time the panel opens. New
  categories drop into `settings/categories/`.
- **UI design-system** (`ui/`) — Reusable, themed primitives. `Ui.Toggle` and
  `Ui.Slider` are **dispatchers**: each renders whichever variant is selected in
  the `UiStyle` singleton (`~/.config/quickshell/ui-style.json`), so any
  component using them follows the global Appearance setting. Variants are plain
  files (`ToggleCapsule/Square/Notch`, `SliderThin/Thick`) sharing one API —
  adding a style is one file + one line. Sliders show a **value bubble** on
  hover/drag (a percentage for 0–1 sliders, an integer otherwise). `Ui.Dropdown`
  is a single themed
  dropdown (Matugen colors, Nerd Font chevron, themed popup list) that replaces
  the system `ComboBox` shell-wide. Consumed by the Settings panel, the
  WiFi/Bluetooth toggles, audio sliders, and the wallpaper picker. `Ui.Icon`
  renders SVG/theme icons at an exact size (so they never vary the way font
  glyphs do) and optionally recolors them to the accent — used by the Settings
  sidebar and About pane with Papirus *symbolic* icons.
- **Mascot** — Sprite-based desktop pet ("Oreo Cat") that roams the screen
  with gravity. Wanders with occasional sit/nap idles and a rare box-play
  routine; reacts to clicks (pet / hop), a fast cursor swipe (run away),
  low battery (sleep), high CPU (run), fullscreen (hide in a corner), and
  notifications (attack). Pure behavior/physics logic lives in a
  dependency-free `brain.js` with `node:test` coverage. See
  [the mascot README](quickshell/mascot/README.md).

**Theme system:**
`Theme.qml` loads colors from `~/.config/quickshell/theme/colors.json` (generated by Matugen) and watches the file for real-time updates. Entire UI recolors dynamically when the wallpaper changes. Colors come from the wallpaper by default, or from a fixed **static seed color** set in Settings → Appearance — `hypr/scripts/apply-theme.sh` is the single Matugen entry point (`matugen color hex` for static, `matugen image` for auto) so the four templates (Quickshell, tmux, yazi, hyprlock) stay in sync.

---

## Matugen

Generates Material You colors from the wallpaper.

**Workflow:**
1. Hyprland autostarts `matugen image ~/dotfiles/wallpapers/main.jpg`
2. Matugen runs the template at `matugen/templates/quickshell-colors.json`
3. Outputs `~/.config/quickshell/theme/colors.json`
4. Quickshell picks up the file change and recolors live

To manually regenerate colors:
```sh
matugen image ~/dotfiles/wallpapers/main.jpg
```

---

## Nvim

Neovim config using lazy.nvim. Entry point: `init.lua`.

**Structure:**
```
nvim/
├── init.lua
└── lua/config/
    ├── core/          — options, keymaps
    ├── lazy.lua       — plugin manager
    └── plugins/       — per-plugin config files
```

**LSP servers (auto-installed via Mason):**
`lua_ls`, `intelephense`, `html`, `emmet_ls`, `cssls`, `ts_ls`, `pyright`, `clangd`, `qmlls`

**Key bindings (Leader = Space):**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| jk | Escape (insert mode) |
| Leader + ee | File tree (Neo-tree) |
| Leader + sv/sh | Split vertical/horizontal |
| Leader + y | Yank to system clipboard |
| Ctrl+D / Ctrl+U | Scroll (cursor centered) |

---

## GRUB

Custom GRUB theme with `main.png` background and Monaspace Neon font.

**Files:**
- `grub` — `/etc/default/grub` config (copied by deploy script)
- `theme.txt` — boot menu styling (deployed to `/boot/grub/themes/custom/`)
- `main.png` — boot screen background (deployed to `/boot/grub/themes/custom/main.png`)
- `deploy.sh` — deploys all GRUB files and regenerates config

**Deploy** (run after any change to grub files):
```sh
bash ~/dotfiles/grub/deploy.sh
```

The deploy script compiles the Monaspace Neon font (size 24) to GRUB's `.pf2` format, copies all files to `/boot/grub/themes/custom/`, and runs `grub-mkconfig`.

> `/boot` is on a separate FAT32 partition so symlinks from home are not possible — deploy script is used instead.

---

## Wallpaper

`wallpapers/main.jpg` is used by Hyprland and Matugen. GRUB uses its own `grub/main.png`.

- **Hyprland** — desktop background (both monitors via hyprpaper)
- **Matugen** — color scheme source
- **GRUB** — `grub/main.png` (separate file, deployed to `/boot/grub/themes/custom/`)

To change the desktop wallpaper, replace `wallpapers/main.jpg` and run `matugen image ~/dotfiles/wallpapers/main.jpg`.
To change the GRUB background, replace `grub/main.png` and run `bash ~/dotfiles/grub/deploy.sh`.
